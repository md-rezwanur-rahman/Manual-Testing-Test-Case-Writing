Testing Approach
1. Test Planning
Understanding project requirements and defining the test scope.
Identifying key functionalities to be tested.
Estimating effort and resources required for manual testing.

2. Test Case Design
Writing detailed test cases for functional, UI, and negative testing.
Covering edge cases and exploratory testing scenarios.
Ensuring test cases are clear, concise, and repeatable.

3. Test Execution
Running test cases manually and documenting results.
Reporting any defects found during testing.
Retesting fixed defects to ensure they are resolved.
Conducting regression testing to check for unintended issues.

4. Defect Reporting
Logging defects with detailed steps to reproduce.
Assigning priority and severity for proper resolution.
Tracking defect status until closure.
Verifying bug fixes and maintaining defect logs.

Tools Used
Excel: Used for test case documentation and reporting.
JIRA / Bug Tracking Tool (if applicable): Used for defect tracking and management.
TestRail / Other Test Management Tool (if applicable): Used for test case management and execution tracking.

Benefits of Manual Testing
Detects usability and UI issues effectively.
Provides exploratory testing opportunities.
Ensures application functionality from an end-user perspective.
Helps identify critical bugs that automated tests may miss.

Conclusion
This manual testing project ensures that the application meets the defined requirements and functions correctly. The test cases and reports provide a structured approach to identifying and addressing defects before deployment. Comprehensive test planning and execution contribute to delivering a high-quality application with a seamless user experience.
